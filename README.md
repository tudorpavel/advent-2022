# Advent of Code 2022

This year I will be attempting to solve [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) problems using Go. I've gone through the [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1) but I'll be learning more as I _go_ along.

## Setup

Go version used:

```
asdf install golang 1.19.3
```

To run a particular day `cd` into the folder, add your input to an `input.txt` file and run:

```
go run . < input.txt
```

To run all tests for a particular day, run:

```
go test
```
